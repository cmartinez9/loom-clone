# Project agent memory

This file is the project's committed home for project-intrinsic agent knowledge: build, test, release, architecture, and sharp-edge notes that should travel with the code.

## What this is

A **local-only, macOS-only** Loom-style screen recorder and editor, built in Electron.
No cloud, no account, no upload. Being built in fourteen phases against a fixed design.

## The authoritative documents — read these before changing anything structural

These live outside the repo and outrank this file, the code, and your own judgement.
If you believe one is wrong, say so; do not silently diverge, because other phases are
compiling against it.

## Commands

```bash
npm run build       # esbuild main + preload, vite renderer -> dist/
npm start           # build, then run the app
npm run dev         # rebuild on change and restart Electron
npm run verify      # typecheck + lint + format:check + test  (what CI runs)
npm test            # vitest
npm run verify:mutation   # break the capture writer five ways; each must fail the gate
npm run package     # electron-builder, macOS only
node scripts/seed-fixtures.mjs <root>            # example recordings to look at
node scripts/make-capture-fixture.mjs            # regenerate the encoded-frame fixture (needs ffmpeg)
npm run build && node scripts/smoke-capture.mjs  # record the real screen once, end to end
npx electron scripts/screenshot.cjs --out shots --theme light   # capture the real windows
```

## Layout

```
packages/format/   the on-disk format: schemas, types, validation, migrations,
                   writeAtomic, the edit journal.  `@loom/format` is PURE (no node,
                   no DOM); `@loom/format/fs` is the filesystem half.
packages/mux/      the fragmented-MP4 writer and the scanner recovery reads it with.
                   `@loom/mux` is PURE; `@loom/mux/fs` owns the file descriptor and,
                   like `@loom/format/fs`, has exactly one caller.
packages/ipc/      the typed main<->renderer contract. Not in the report's §1.3 list;
                   §1.4 requires a shared contract and this is it.
packages/design/   "Pressroom": tokens, type scale, icons, self-hosted fonts.
apps/main/         Electron main: WindowRegistry, ProjectStore, RecorderSession,
                   loom:// protocol, IPC.
apps/renderer/     renderer windows. Library, recorder HUD and the hidden capture
                   page today; overlay and editor later.
```

Later phases add `packages/edl`, `packages/compositor`, `packages/decode` and
`apps/export` beside these (report §1.3). The report also lists `apps/capture`; the
hidden capture page lives in `apps/renderer/src/capture/` instead, because a window
in this repo is a role in `apps/main/src/windows.ts` plus an entry in
`apps/renderer/vite.config.ts`, and a second renderer app would fork that.

## The four rules that are not style preferences

1. **Main is the only writer to disk.** Renderers propose; main persists. Enforced
   structurally, not by convention: sandboxed renderers have no filesystem at all,
   `eslint.config.mjs` restricts `node:fs`, `@loom/format/fs` and `@loom/mux/fs` to
   `apps/main/src/project-store.ts` (plus read-only `media-reader.ts`), and a `.lock`
   file keeps a second app instance out of a bundle. Adding a second writer is an
   architecture change, not a refactor. That includes the 30 Hz capture path: chunks
   reach the disk through `ProjectStore.appendMediaChunk` like everything else.
2. **Raw and decoded frames never cross IPC.** Encoded chunks do (measured 289 MB/s
   against a ~2 MB/s need). `packages/ipc/test/ipc-boundary.test.ts` fails the build
   if `VideoFrame`, `AudioData`, `ImageBitmap` or friends appear in the contract or
   the preload. The preload exposes named channels only — never a generic `invoke`.
3. **The bundle identifier is frozen.** `com.github.cmartinez9.loom-clone`, declared
   once in `apps/main/src/identity.ts`. macOS TCC keys every permission grant on it;
   changing it costs the user Screen Recording, Camera, Microphone and Accessibility,
   and produces black frames that look like a bug in our code. `identity.test.ts`
   fails if it drifts.
4. **No AI-generated look.** A binding review criterion, not taste: no gradients, no
   `backdrop-filter`, no blurred shadows, no blue-black neutrals, no Inter, no emoji
   as iconography. `packages/design/test/no-generic-look.test.ts` enforces the
   mechanical half. Rationale: `data/loom-design/report.md` §2 and §8.

## The format, in one paragraph

A recording is a `.loomrec` **directory** of independently-captured, independently-
timestamped artifacts (`media/`, `events/`, `cursors/`, `thumbs/`) plus a separate,
versioned `edit.json` describing how to compose them. Nothing is baked into pixels
until export. Every file carries `"schema": "<family>/<n>"` on line one and every read
runs **parse → migrate → validate**; an unknown or future schema is refused, never
guessed at — except `edit.journal.ndjson`, which degrades instead: its entries are
withheld and the file is preserved aside, but the recording still opens from its
`edit.json`, because an unreadable header must not brick a recording.
Writes go through `writeAtomic` (temp file, `fsync`, `rename`, then
`fsync` the directory — the last step is the one people leave out). Edits are appended
to `edit.journal.ndjson` as one op per line and snapshotted into `edit.json` on a
debounce, so an editor crash costs at most 250 ms.

Time is **seconds, float**, everywhere except the frame index sidecar. Media tracks
are lists of parts (`screen.000.mp4`) from day one, never a single file.

## Capture, in one paragraph

A hidden renderer runs `getDisplayMedia` → `MediaStreamTrackProcessor` →
`VideoEncoder` and sends **encoded chunks** to main, which writes each one as its own
`moof`+`mdat` fragment the instant it exists. One sample per fragment is the crash
budget made explicit: a `SIGKILL` costs what this process still holds, so a fragment
is one frame (~110 bytes of overhead, ~0.2% at 12 Mbps) rather than the report's
"≤ 1 s". The writer holds exactly one sample so every duration is measured against
the next frame's timestamp, which a variable-rate screen track needs. `recording.json`
is written **before the first frame** with the facts only a live session knows
(display, scale factor, permissions); recovery corrects it rather than inventing it.
The frame index is held in memory and written at finalize — recovery rebuilds it by
scanning the fragments, which is strictly better than a checkpoint and avoids
rewriting a growing JSON once a second for the length of the recording.

## Sharp edges

- **Bracket notation is deliberate.** `tsconfig.json` sets
  `noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature`; `doc['schema']` is how this codebase says "this
  key may not be there".
- **The preload is CommonJS.** A sandboxed preload has to be. `main` is bundled to CJS
  to match.
- **There is no dev server.** Windows load from `loom://app` in development exactly as
  in a packaged app, so origin, CSP and asset paths cannot differ between them.
- **Every `edit.json`/`project.json` write is serialized** through `ProjectStore`'s
  per-project queue. Checking a revision outside it lets two batches both read
  revision _n_ and both append as _n + 1_. **Media appends are a separate queue**, per
  part, on purpose: they share no revision, write a different file, and must not be
  able to queue behind a snapshot's recursive bundle-size walk — anything queued in
  memory is exactly what a crash costs.
- **A crash test that does not kill production code proves nothing.** Phase 0 shipped
  one that killed a copy of `writeAtomic`. Both gates now kill the real path, both
  have a control that must fail, and `npm run verify:mutation` breaks the writer on
  disk and requires the tests to notice. Add a mutation when you add a property.
- **Playability is checked with `/usr/bin/avconvert`**, which is AVFoundation and
  ships with macOS, so the check runs on a CI runner with no ffmpeg. ffprobe is used
  additionally when the machine happens to have it.
- **`fsync` on macOS is not `F_FULLFSYNC`.** What `writeAtomic` promises is that a
  _process_ death leaves the old bytes or the new ones, never a mixture — proved by
  `packages/format/test/kill-mid-write.test.ts`, which includes a naive-writer control
  so it cannot pass vacuously.
- **Test from a signed bundle at least once** before trusting anything permission
  related: in development, TCC is inherited from the terminal (research report §7,
  trap 6).

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file for knowledge useful to almost every future agent session in this project.
Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
Prefer rewriting or pruning existing entries over appending new ones.
When updating this file, preserve this bar for all agents and keep entries concise.
